TimeBomb
========

TimeBomb or Time Machine: Automatically turn on and off applications at a specified time.

This application is still under development, but for testing purpose and though for contributions from github users, I posted it in here.

TimeBomb is actually the name of the class that has all these implementations. But later I thought of this as the name for whole project, when published.
